                    <p>Madeireira Rio Claro was founded in 1969 by Mr. Julio Wronski Sobrinho in Rio Claro do Sul, a district belonging to the city of Mallet, in the state of Paraná, Brazil.

                    <p>
                        <br>Madeireira Rio Claro exports its products to many parts of the world such as Europe, USA, Asia, Africa, Middle East, Central America and Mercosur. The exportation of our products requires technical characteristics of quality and performance defined by the standards sef by importing countries like the United States – Standard PS 1-09, Europe – EC Rules. These sets of standards are named Certification.
                        <br>In order to have certification for a product, the company must hire a legally authorized agency to that end, in according to the international norms and regulatory standards. After aligning the procecess to the standard requirements an initial audit is carried out to assess whether the company fulfilled all the requirements and only then, receives the certification. Once certified, the company is audited regularly by this board, that checks whether the standard is being maintained regarding the traceability of the documents related to the production process, internal controls and testing in own laboratory. Once compliance with the standard and product traceability is proved, certification is maintained.
                        <br>To meet the requirements of international quality standards, we have our own laboratories. One being used in the analysis of inputs, quality control tracking and continuous analysis of our veneers of plywood. The other laboratory, where temperature and humidity is carefyllly is intended to run tests as structural shear, bending, stiffness, permeability and others. Our panels used for shuttering are also tested in our own laboratories.
